# The evaluation zone

`crates/rfish-engine/src/eval/` — the NNUE network and the classical fallback.

Golden: `Stockfish/src/evaluate.cpp`, `Stockfish/src/nnue/`.

## Status: the forward pass is ported and bit-exact

`cargo xtask nnue-check` drives rfish and a pristine upstream build over the same positions
and compares the raw network output — the number upstream's `eval` prints as "internal
units", with no optimism blend and no fifty-move damping on top. Every position in
`tools/cases/eval.fens` matches **exactly**, including 60 reached by random legal play,
which is what makes it a check on the feature indexing rather than on a list the port was
written against.

What is **not** done is the incremental accumulator. See "The accumulator is recomputed"
below.

Eight output heads exist; `(pieces - 1) / 4` selects one. Both the PSQT score and the
positional score come back separately, because the search blends them by their
**disagreement** — a position the two heads argue about is one to be less confident in, and
the optimism term weighs more there.

## The three feature sets

A feature is an index into the transformer's weight table. The network sees a position only
as the SET of indices that are active, so an index computed one off is not a small error: it
reads a different column of weights.

| set | dims | encodes |
|---|---|---|
| `HalfKAv2_hm` | 22528 | own king square × (piece, square) |
| `FullThreats` | 59808 | (attacker, from) attacking (attacked, to) |
| `PP_3Wide` | 4560 | pairs of pawns within one file of each other |

Three details that are easy to get subtly wrong, and that a wrong answer would not announce:

- **The two orientations are opposites.** `HalfKAv2_hm` mirrors so the king lands on the
  **e-h** files; `FullThreats` and `PP_3Wide` mirror so it lands on the **a-d** files. A
  test asserts they disagree on every square.
- **Threat indices are ranked within the EMPTY-BOARD attack set**, not the occupancy-aware
  one. Which attacks *exist* depends on occupancy; where each sits in the numbering does not.
- **Same-kind threats are recorded once.** Two pieces of one kind attacking each other are
  symmetric, so only the `from > to` direction is encoded — and same-colour pawn pairs are
  excluded outright, because that relationship is `PP_3Wide`'s job.

The threat and pawn-pair sets share one weight array, with the pawn-pair block starting at
the threat set's dimension count. That is why `PP_INDEX_BASE == THREAT_DIMENSIONS`, and a
test asserts it rather than trusting the two constants to stay in step.

## The accumulator is recomputed, not updated

Upstream maintains the transformer's output incrementally: a move changes a handful of
features, so the accumulator is patched rather than rebuilt, with a king-bucket cache
absorbing the case where the king moved.

**rfish recomputes it per evaluation.** That is correct and slow, in that order deliberately:
the from-scratch path is what an incremental path has to agree with, so it is the thing to
have first and the thing an incremental update is later checked against.

The cost is real and measured: around 75 kn/s against upstream's 830 kn/s on the same
machine, an eleven-fold difference that is almost entirely this. The *tree* is upstream's
size, though — the bench searches roughly two million nodes at depth 13 where upstream
searches three million — because the evaluation guiding it is upstream's.

Making it incremental needs the board zone to maintain a per-move threat delta, which it
does not yet. See [01-engine-board.md](01-engine-board.md).

## The quantisation is the specification

Everything is integer arithmetic on a fixed scale, and the shifts are where the scale
changes rather than rounding conveniences:

- The transformer's two halves are clamped to `[0, 255]` and multiplied pairwise, then
  divided by 512. That pairwise product is what gives the first hidden layer a quadratic
  term without a second matrix.
- `ClippedReLU` is `clamp(x >> shift, 0, 127)`.
- `SqrClippedReLU` is `min(127, x² >> (2·shift + 7))`. The extra seven bits stand in for a
  division by 127 that would otherwise cost an instruction; **the trainer knows and
  compensates**, which is why it cannot be "corrected".
- A skip connection adds `fc_0[30] - fc_0[31]` straight to the output. Dropping it costs the
  network its linear term.
- The final scale is `fwd × 600 × 16 / (128 × 2⁶ × 2)`, in `i64`, truncating toward zero.

## No intrinsics

Upstream's kernels are hand-vectorised behind one `#if` per instruction set. `std::arch`
intrinsics are `unsafe` and `std::simd` is nightly, so rfish writes ordinary loops over
fixed-size arrays and lets LLVM vectorise them under `-C target-cpu`.

The arithmetic implemented is upstream's **scalar fallback** — which upstream keeps
precisely so its vector paths have something to be bit-identical to. That is what makes
`nnue-check` a meaningful comparison rather than a comparison of two approximations.

## The net is a runtime input, never embedded

`cargo xtask net` fetches it into `resources/`. The engine looks in the working directory,
then `resources/`, then beside the executable — which is why every gate runs it from
`resources/`.

**A missing net is not an error**, but it is a different engine. `evaluate` falls back to
[`classical`](../crates/rfish-engine/src/eval/classical.rs) and the engine says so on
startup and in `eval`'s own output. A file that exists but fails to load is reported as the
failure it is, rather than falling back silently.

**Check for the `info string NNUE evaluation using …` line before believing any node
count.** A measurement taken without a net is a measurement of a different engine, and the
number looks entirely plausible.

## The classical term is not a feature

Do not tune it. Do not extend it. Do not let it acquire callers NNUE will not satisfy. It
exists so the engine starts and plays without a 90 MiB download, and so every gate above the
evaluation can run without one.

Two properties it does have to hold, because the search depends on them: **antisymmetry** (a
position and its colour-flipped mirror score the same from each mover's point of view — the
tempo bonus is added *after* taking the mover's point of view for exactly this reason) and
**material dominance**.
